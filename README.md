# Pagila End-to-End Analytics Pipeline

> **CDC-based analytics pipeline on Google Cloud — from an operational PostgreSQL database to executive dashboards in Tableau and Metabase.**

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world analytics-engineering workflow for a fictional DVD-rental business (using the open-source **Pagila** PostgreSQL dataset). It implements a production-style pipeline that:

1. **Replicates** an operational PostgreSQL database into a BigQuery data warehouse in near real-time using **Google Datastream (CDC)**.
2. **Transforms** the raw data into clean, queryable models following a **dbt-inspired staging → reporting layering**.
3. **Orchestrates** the Python ETL scripts via **cron** for repeatable scheduled runs.
4. **Surfaces** insights to business users through **Tableau Public** and **Metabase** dashboards.

The goal: demonstrate the full analytics engineering lifecycle — ingestion, modeling, orchestration, visualization, version control — on the same toolchain used by mid-to-large data teams in industry.

## Architecture

![Pipeline Architecture](documents/Data_Analytics_Pipeline.png)

| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | PostgreSQL (Pagila) | Operational transactional database |
| **Replication** | Google Datastream | CDC streaming into BigQuery |
| **Data Warehouse** | Google BigQuery | Serverless cloud DWH |
| **Transformation** | Python (Jupyter → `.py`) | Staging + reporting models |
| **Orchestration** | Cron | Scheduled ETL execution |
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub | Code review & collaboration |
| **BI / Viz** | Tableau Public & Metabase | Self-serve analytics |

### Metabase
Metabase runs locally via Docker and connects directly to BigQuery using a GCP service-account key. Each business question is answered as a standalone Metabase question.

## Methodology — Layered Data Modeling

Inspired by **dbt's recommended project structure**, the warehouse is organized into two clean layers (the intermediate layer is intentionally omitted to keep the scope focused):

**Staging layer (`staging_db`)** — One-to-one with the source. Standardizes column names (e.g., `name` → `category_name`), applies prefixes for clarity, and casts data types. **No business logic.** Each staging script is independently runnable and idempotent.

**Reporting layer (`reporting_db`)** — Business-ready marts.

- `rep_revenue_per_period` covers `Day`, `Month`, `Year` grain from 2015 onward, includes zero-revenue periods (gaps closed via an `all_dates` calendar), and excludes the non-billed film *GOODFELLAS SALUTE*.
- `rep_revenue_per_customer_and_period` provides per-customer revenue at `Day`, `Month`, and `Year` grain — only for dates with actual revenue, same exclusion applied.

This separation makes it trivial to (a) debug a single source independently, (b) reuse staging tables across multiple reporting models, and (c) hand the reporting layer to BI tools without exposing raw warehouse complexity.

## Reproducing the Pipeline

### Prerequisites
- A Google Cloud project with **BigQuery** and **Datastream** APIs enabled
- A service account with `BigQuery Data Editor` + `BigQuery Job User` roles (JSON key)
- Python 3.10+
- Access to the Pagila PostgreSQL instance (or a local clone)

### 1. Configure CDC replication
Run, then immediately start the Datastream private connection:
```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('student_replication', 'pgoutput');
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
```

### 3. Build the warehouse
```bash
# Staging layer
for f in scripts/staging/*.py; do python "$f"; done

# Reporting marts
python scripts/reporting/rep_revenue_per_period.py
python scripts/reporting/rep_revenue_per_customer_and_period.py
python scripts/reporting/rep_rentals_per_customer_and_period.py
python scripts/reporting/rep_rentals_per_period.py
python scripts/reporting/rep_customers_ordered.py
python scripts/reporting/rep_films_rented.py
python scripts/reporting/rep_rental_details.py
```

### 4. Schedule with cron
```bash
chmod +x job-orchestration/run_staging.sh
crontab -e
# Example: run daily at 02:30
30 2 * * * /absolute/path/to/job-orchestration/run_staging.sh >> /tmp/pipeline.log 2>&1
```

### 5. Connect Metabase via Docker
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
# Open http://localhost:3000 and connect using the GCP service-account JSON
```

## Next Steps — Extended BI Visualizations & Medallion Architecture Implementation.

Plan is to deepen the DW with Medallion Architecture implementation & develop the dashboard layer by exposing the full richness of the reporting marts currently underutilized in BI tools.
